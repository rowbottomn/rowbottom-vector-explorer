# rowbottom-vector-explorer
A processing sketch which allows students to explore the physics of a particle experiencing a 1/r^2 force

Features:
V1_0 
Vectors drawn for acceleration and velocity
tracers show the particle's path
can turn on and scale resistive force

V2_0
To do
Calculate kinetic, potential energy and energy lost (work done by F_nc)
